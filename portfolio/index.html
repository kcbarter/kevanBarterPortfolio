                        Origanally a solo project but now a pair project where we are building out a web application via Java Spring Boot. Currently we have the 
                        website hooked up to a SQL database to store info to a database. Currently some basic CRUD operations are set up. For this project we are 
                        working in sprints to get tasks done.
